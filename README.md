# Socket-Chat
Working with Socket


Just a basic layout for working with node.js, express, and socket. An easy starting point for chat features that use socket.io for real-time updates.

## Starting 

'npm install' to install necessary dependencies, then 'npm start' to start server. Only works with localhost:3000.

Enjoy.
